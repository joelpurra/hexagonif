Played around with the HTML5 `<canvas>` element for use in the background of a website, and ended up with this little toy. [Play around with the interactive demo.](https://joelpurra.com/projects/hexagonif/) The name "hexagonif" comes from [hexagon](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hexagon) and [gonif](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gonif).
